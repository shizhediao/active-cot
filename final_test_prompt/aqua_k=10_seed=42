There are a total of 40 managers, and the rest of the employees are associates. If there are a total of 135 male associates, how many female managers are there? Answer Choices: (A)95 (B)20 (C)85 (D)75 (E)35\nA:",
            "rationale": "Well, first let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take care of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totals\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. The numbers in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totals\u00e2\u20ac\u009d row must add up. If 90 are females, the other 180 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 90 = 90 must be males. Similarly, the numbers in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totals\u00e2\u20ac\u009d column must add up. If 40 are managers, then the other 180 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 40 = 140 must be associates. Now, in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153associate\u00e2\u20ac\u009d row, 135 + E = 140, which means E = 5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the other 5 associates must be female. Now, to find B, which is what the question is asking, we need only look at the sum in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153female\u00e2\u20ac\u009d column: B +5 = 90, which means B = 85. There are fifteen female managers in this company. Thus, the answer = (C)",
