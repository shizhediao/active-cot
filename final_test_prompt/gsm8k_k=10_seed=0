The Monday-Saturday papers weigh 8 ounces each.  The Sunday paper weighs twice as much.  He is supposed to deliver 250 papers a day.  He doesn't deliver them for 10 weeks.  If one ton of paper recycles for $20, how much did he make?\nA:",
            "rationale": "We know that 7-1=6 days the paper weighs 8 ounces. So those contribute 6*8=48 ounces per week. So in total a weekly delivery of papers weighs 48+16=64 ounces. That means it weighs 64/16=4 pounds. So each week he delivers 4*250=1000 pounds of paper. So in 10 weeks, he delivers 10*1000=10000 pounds of paper. That weighs 10000/2000=5 tons of paper. So he makes 5*20=$100 from recycling the paper",

He is currently working for three clients, with the first client paying him half the amount of money he currently has on his dashboard once the job is done. The second client will pay him 2/5 times more money than the first client once Baylor finishes his work. The third client will pay him twice the amount of money the first and second clients pay him together once he finishes the job. How much money will Baylor have in his dashboard after all the clients pay him for his work?\nA:",

The total amount of money the second client will pay Baylor once the job is done is $2000+$800 = $2800. The total amount of money the first and the second client will pay Baylor after their work is finished is $2800+$2000 = $4800. The third client will pay him twice the amount of money the first and second clients pay him together, a total of 2*$4800 = $9600. Together, the three clients will pay Baylor $9600+$4800 = $14400 once he finishes their jobs. In his dashboard, Baylor will have $14400+$4000 = $18400",

However, this year, the apple tree yield was excellent, and it grew 200 apples. Magdalena picked 1/5 of the fruits on the first day, twice that number on the second day, and 20 more apples than he picked on the first day on the third day. Calculate the total number of apples remaining in the tree.\nA:",

The total number of apples that he picked on the third day is 40 apples + 20 apples = 60 apples. In total, she picked 40 apples + 80 apples + 60 apples = 180 apples in the three days.

If an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, and a male has 5 more than this, and a child has half as many as an adult woman, how many bones are in the graveyard?\nA:",
            "rationale": "We first need to figure out how many of each type of skeleton there are. Since half the 20 skeletons are adult women, that means there are 20/2=10 adult women's skeletons. The remaining half, 10, is split between adult men and children, meaning there are 10/2= 5 of each. Since an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, this means that the 10 skeletons have 20*10=200 bones in total. Since an adult man has 5 more bones in their body than an adult woman, this means they have 20+5= 25 bones in their body. There are 5 adult men, meaning there are 25*5=125 bones in the adult male skeletons in total. Since a child has half as many bones as the 20 in an adult woman, this means the children have 20/2= 10 bones in their body. Since there are 5 children, this means there are 5*10= 50 bones in the children's skeletons in total. Therefore, altogether there are 50+125+200= 375 bones in total in the graveyard.",

If rent and other fixed expense for the shop is $4000 a month how much profit did the shop make?\nA:",
