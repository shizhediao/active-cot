	        "rationale": "Let's think step by step. To calculate how much Connor will spend on his date, we need to know the cost of each item. The tickets cost $10.00 each, and he has to buy 2 tickets, so that is 10 * 2 = $20.00. They each grab a box of candy that's $2.50 a box, so that will cost 2 * 2.50 = $5.00. The tickets cost $20.00, the candy is $5.00, and the combo is $11.00, so Connor will spend 20 + 5 + 11 = $36.00 during his date."

There were 9 seasons before the announcement.  If each episode is .5 hours how long will it take to watch them all after the last season finishes?\nA:",

To calculate how long it will take to watch them all after the last season finishes, we need to know how many episodes and how long it will take to watch one episode. There are currently 9 * 22 = 198 episodes out. The new season will have 22 + 4=26 episodes. So the total number of episodes is 198 + 26 = 224 episodes. So it will take 224 * 0.5 = 112 hours to watch them all."

Each batch serves 6 people, and there are 42 people coming to the party, so she needs to make 42 / 6 = 7 batches. Each batch requires 4 avocados, so she will need 4 * 7 = 28 avocados."

The difference in age between Joel and his dad is 32 - 5 = 27 years. When you double this gap in years, you have 27 x 2 = 54. When his dad is 54, Joel will be 54 / 2 = 27 years old."

To calculate how many hours it takes Veronica to pit all the cherries, we need to know how many cherries are in total and how many hours it takes for a unit of cherries. There are 80 cherries in a pound, and she needs 3 pounds to make a pie, so she needs 80 * 3 = 240 cherries. It takes her 10 minutes to pit a unit of 20 cherries. She has 240 / 20 = 12 units of cherries to pit. It takes 10 minutes to pit a unit of cherries, and she has 12 units, so that it will take her 10 * 12 = 120 minutes. 60 minutes are in 1 hour, and it takes her 120 minutes so that\u2019s 120 / 60 = 2 hours."

Since the plant will be 80 feet tall at most after a year, it will have grown by 80 - 20 = 60 feet tall after a year. Since a year has 12 months, the tree will grow at 60 / 12 = 5 feet every month."

To calculate how many orange balls there are, we need to know the total number of pink balls and orange balls, the equation between the number of pink balls, the number of orange balls, and the total number of them. The number of pink and orange balls is 50 - 20 - 10 = 20. Let x be the number of orange balls. Since there are 3 times as many pink balls as orange balls, the number of pink balls is 3 * x. Then we have the equation x + 3 * x = 20, and solve for x = 5."
