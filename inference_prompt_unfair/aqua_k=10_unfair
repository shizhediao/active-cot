            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. Imagine starting out with 100 ml of 50% milk tea. In step 1, 15% of the tea is replaced with milk. Thus, 85% of the original tea remains. Since this is done twice, we have a concentration of 50x0.85x0.85% (=36.125%) of tea solution. Finally, 10% of this solution is replaced with milk again. So, the final concentration of tea is 36.125*0.9%. This equals 32.51% of tea solution",
