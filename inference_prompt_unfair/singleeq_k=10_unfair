            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. To answer the question of what is the smallest of the three numbers, we need to know the relationship between the three consecutive even numbers and their sum. Let x be the smallest number. Since all three even numbers are consecutive, we let the second number be x + 2, and the third number be x + 4. Since the sum of three consecutive even numbers is 162, we have the equation x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 162. Solve the equation we have x = 52, which is the smallest number.",

To answer the question of what is her weekly allowance if she ended with 12 dollars, we need to know the relation between her weekly allowance, the 8 dollars earned from washing the family car, and the 12 dollars ended. Let x be her allowance. Since Alyssa spent half of her allowance going to the movies and then earned 8 dollars from washing the family car and ended with 12 dollars, we have the equation (x / 2) + 8 = 12.

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. To answer the question of how many minutes was Milan billed for, we need to know what is the billing fee per minute in dollars, the relation between the 2 dollars monthly fee, the per-minute fee, and the total bill. Since the per-minute fee is 12 cents, it is 12 * 0.01 = 0.12 dollars per minute. Let x be the minutes Milan was billed for. Since the total bill consists of 2 dollars monthly fee and 0.12 dollars per minute fee, we have the equation 2 + 0.12 * x = 23.36. Solve the equation we have x = 178 minutes, which is the total number of minutes Milan was billed for.",

To answer the question of how much money did Tim get, we need to know the total number of nickels Tim got, the total number of dimes Tim got, the total number of half-dollars Tim got, and their values in terms of dollars. Tim got a total of 3 nickels, which is 3 * 0.05 = 0.15 dollars. Tim got a total of 13 + 7 = 20 dimes, which is 20 * 0.1 = 2 dollars. Tim got a total of 9 half-dollars, which is a total of 9 * 0.5 = 4.5 dollars. Therefore, Tim got a total of 0.15 + 2 + 4.5 = 6.65 dollars.",

To answer the question of how many students were in each bus, we need to know how many students got on the buses and then divide the number of buses by the number of students that got on the buses. Since all 7 buses were filled and 4 students had to travel in cars, there were a total of 375 - 4 = 371 students got on the buses.
